<h2>people.apache.org has been decommissioned</h2>
<p>The committer-index.html page has been superseded by the <a href="phonebook.html">Apache Phonebook</a>
<br/>
Usage notes are available in the <a href="phonebook-about.html">Apache Phonebook Description</a>
<p>
For example you can look up the <a href="phonebook.html?unix=committers">list of current committers</a>
</p>
<p>
Or you can look up a committer directly as follows:
<br/>
<code>http://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=user-id</code>
<br/>
This corresponds to the original URL:
<br/>
<code>http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#user-id</code>
</p>
<p>There is also a list of <a href="unlistedclas.html">Persons with signed CLAs but who are not (yet) committers.</a>
This is useful for checking if a CLA has been received and recorded in the 
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/officers/iclas.txt">iclas.txt</a> file which is maintained by the secretary.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.apache.org/keys/committer/">PGP keys of committers</a> are available.</p>
