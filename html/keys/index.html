<p>
ASF committers can add key fingerprints to their LDAP record using the <a href="https://id.apache.org/">Self-service</a> web application.
<br/>
Only the fingerprints are stored in the LDAP record.
<br/>
The corresponding keys must be uploaded to a public key server.
</p>
<h1>Committer public key files</h1>
<p>
The files in the <a href="committer">Committer keys</a> directory are autogenerated from LDAP records and grouped by ASF id.
<br/>
(The public keys are downloaded from a public key server using the fingerprints from LDAP)
</p>
<h1>Project public key files</h1>
<p>
The files in the <a href="group">Project keys</a> directory are generated from the Committer keys, and grouped by project/podling.
<br/>
Project membership is determined from the LDAP unix and committee groups (not committee-info.txt) 
and the <a href="https://whimsy.apache.org/public/public_nonldap_groups.json">current podlings</a> listing from Whimsy.
</p>
<p>
Note: the project group files are <b>not directly suitable</b> for use as KEYS files for authenticating releases - i.e. they should <b>not be linked</b> from download pages.
<br/> 
This is because:
<ul>
<li>The KEYS files must be stored in the ASF mirror directories. This ensures that they are archived along with the releases to which they apply.</li>
<li>The KEYS file are needed to check signatures of archived releases. 
Thus keys should only ever be added to the KEYS file, and never normally removed.
Now the LDAP group for a project will change over time, and a committer who signed one or more releases may no longer be in the group.
Also if a project moves to the Attic, its LDAP group will be removed.</li>
</ul>
Individual committer key details can be copied from the committer or group files into the project KEYS file.<br/>
To keep the KEYS file manageable, it's recommended to only add the keys of committers who have signed releases.
