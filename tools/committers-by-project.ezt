<p>
  This page lists all LDAP groups and the SVN authorization groups found in
  the SVN authorization file and shows the membership of the corresponding groups.
</p>
<p>
<!-- TODO
  Entries in <em>italics</em> do <b>NOT</b> have a signed 
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Contributor License Agreement</a> on file (this knowledge is keyed by SVN id).
  <br>
-->
  Entries in <b>bold</b> are ASF members. 
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the authorisation groups are used to provide access to certain services.
  For example membership of the <a href="#pmc-chairs">pmc-chairs</a> group allows the holder to update
  the Unix and committee LDAP groups.
  However, membership of the pmc-chairs group does not necessarily mean that the holder is currently the chair of a PMC.
  Similarly, membership of the commons-pmc LDAP group does not necessarily imply that the holder is a member of the Commons PMC.
</p>
<p>
  The official documentation for membership of PMCs is the 
  <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt">committee-info.txt</a> file.
  This requires an ASF login to view.
</p>
<p>
  Membership of the Unix LDAP groups (e.g. tomcat) generally gives write access to SVN.
  Memership of the LDAP committee groups (e.g. tomcat-pmc) generally gives write access to the dist/release area for releasing files.
  The PMC may also have a private area under https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/{pmc} in which case
  membership of the corresponding LDAP committee group gives both read and write access.
</p>
<p>
  Entries in the "SVN id" column link back to the corresponding entry in the <a href="committer-index.html">Committer Index</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Committers may provide homepage URLs in LDAP.
  <br>
  Login to https://id.apache.org/ and populate the "Homepage URL:" field.
  <br>
  Any such entries are shown as links in the Name column.
